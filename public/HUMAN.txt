Instinct the means to react to environment,
the will to survive, reproduction in kind,
to thrive and propel genes throughout time,
biology defined, primal depths of the mind,

Emotions are next, insight and context,
motives refined, decisions aligned with stress,
compulsive, rarely benign, constructive at best,
corrosive when blind, nature ain't perfect, not yet,

(Give it time)

Consciousness is awareness, your senses combined,
intelligence, expression, and theory of mind, 
not just for our kind, there's others alike,
spectrum cross the kingdom, perpendicular lines,

Different levels and layers depending on brain shape,  
shared D-N-A, language innate, everything feel pain, 
chimps in the stone age and elephants paint, 
many shifting states, seeking substance to take,

(Primates drunk on fruit wine, panthera tripping on D-M-T,
 delphinidae huffing pufferfish and wallabies eating poppies,)

From simple simian to the greatest ape, 
from eat or get ate and reprieves what you make,
from epochs to ages with time, clocks, and dates,
from uncertain fate to the top of the chain,

The origins of humanity, nomadic legacy, 
tribal sects gathering, traveling endlessly, 
the struggles compelling, suffer collectively,
gods of entropy humbling man with catastrophe,

(Doom always impending, connectivity imperative,)

Memetic means conceived the beginning of linguistics,
from oral traditions to written inscriptions,
expanding the limits, hermetic conditions,
ceremonious visions illuminations emitted,
star maps charting the paths they've driven and past,

Agriculture brews, sustainable food,
civilization ensues, populations grew,
ingenuity blooms, technological boom, 
currency moves, class structures consume,
new flaws assumed, new laws instated,
transformation infused, new kinda relations,

(new types of ideation and pantheons created,)

Holy wars, empires in scores, kings follow course, 
no remorse, the proverbs deformed and fall short, 
conquer, enforce, enslave and more, no just courts, 
revolution off shores and still the vision was warped,

Now party lines, religious ties, and ideology contort,
the lower levels of mind, emotions gripped tight with force,
the cause of infighting, polarizing the trite, 
losing sight of the light, no looking back or inside, 
humans confused by their plight, deliberate, designed,
weaponized ignorance lent to blight on horizon line,
(we must combine and unite, we must combine and unite,)

Primitive origins unfit for this existence,  
the ordinance burned the bridges for collective commitments,
fear that madness already captured too many victims enlisted,
Bad actors corrupted and ruptured the functions intrinsic,

I'm no strategist but forts and battlements a catalyst for cataclysm,
what tore up the fabric and turned factions to prisons of schisms within us, 
yet still, we should persist, surpass every limit forbidden in the system we live in, 
that's the true mission we given, the meaning of life's community, peace, and creation unlimited.
